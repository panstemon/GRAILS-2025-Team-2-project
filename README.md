# Environmental Monitoring for Visually Impaired Individuals Through AI-Assisted Audio Guidance

This repository contains a project aimed at enhancing the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals by developing an augmented reality audio stream that monitors the surrounding environment. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision algorithms, this system provides real-time audio feedback about environmental objects and potential hazards.

## Overview

Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges navigating urban and indoor environments due to insufficient accessible infrastructure and the inability to visually detect obstacles. This project seeks to overcome these barriers through augmented reality audio guidance, enhancing the quality of life and autonomy of visually impaired individuals.

The solution identifies and prioritizes objects and obstacles in real-time, delivering concise audio feedback for safer navigation and improved spatial awareness.
